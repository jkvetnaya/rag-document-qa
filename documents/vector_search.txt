Vector search, also known as semantic search, finds similar documents by comparing 
their vector representations using metrics like cosine similarity. Unlike traditional 
keyword search, vector search can find conceptually similar content even when exact 
words don't match.

Key concepts include similarity thresholds, top-k retrieval, and ranking algorithms. 
The quality of embeddings directly impacts search effectiveness.
