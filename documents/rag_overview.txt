Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines the power of 
large language models with external knowledge sources. RAG systems work by first 
retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base, then using that information 
to generate more accurate and contextual responses.

The key components of a RAG system include document ingestion, text chunking, 
embedding creation, vector storage, similarity search, and answer generation. 
This approach helps reduce hallucinations and provides more factual responses.
