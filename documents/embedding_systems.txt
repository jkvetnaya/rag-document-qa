Embedding systems convert text into numerical vectors that capture semantic meaning. 
There are different approaches to creating embeddings:

1. TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): A traditional approach that 
   represents documents based on word frequency and rarity.

2. Dense embeddings: Modern approaches like OpenAI's text-embedding models create 
   dense vector representations that capture deeper semantic relationships.

The choice of embedding system affects the quality of retrieval and the overall 
performance of the RAG system.
